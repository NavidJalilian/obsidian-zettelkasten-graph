# 21a Analysis Paralysis Example

Kodak's digital camera story is a classic example of analysis paralysis - overthinking a decision to the point where no action is taken.

## Definition
Analysis paralysis occurs when:
- Too much time is spent analyzing options
- Fear of making the wrong choice prevents any choice
- Perfect becomes the enemy of good

## Kodak's Case
- They knew digital was the future
- They had the technology first
- But they couldn't decide to cannibalize film
- Result: Competitors made the decision for them

## Broader Applications
