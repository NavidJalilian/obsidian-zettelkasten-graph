# 21b Innovator's Dilemma Context

The Kodak story perfectly illustrates Clayton Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma" - how successful companies can fail by doing everything "right."

## The Dilemma
- Successful companies focus on profitable customers
- They improve existing products incrementally
- Disruptive innovations start in low-end markets
- By the time disruption reaches mainstream, it's too late

## Kodak's Dilemma
- Film was highly profitable
- Digital cameras were initially low-quality
- Kodak's customers (photo labs) didn't want digital
- But digital eventually became good enough

## Related Concepts
- Sustaining vs. disruptive innovation
- Resource allocation challenges
- Customer-driven vs. technology-driven strategy
